# Watch Your Space

Watch Your Space is a cool website made to show you interesting data, ranging from photos taken by Mars rovers on days you choose.
Watch Your Space can also track data returned by the recently launched Perseverance rover. 

# Planned Features
I plan on adding many new features to this.
Here are a few I would like to add within the next 6 months time.

 1. Forums / community (signup, login, posting etc.)
 2. Rover tracking (navigation data).
 3. 3D Mars globe w/ navigation data of rovers currently on Mars.

# Suggestions
Do you have any cool ideas for the project? Visit https://watchyourspace.ml/ideas.html (page available to public by 30th August, 2021).
I will try to add as many features I can if I think they are "cool" and fit the theme of the website (astronomy and space data).

# Contributors
I later may make some people from the public contributors so that they can help assist me in making Watch Your Space. But, for now, I do not intend on giving anyone contributor since I want to work on the project myself.
